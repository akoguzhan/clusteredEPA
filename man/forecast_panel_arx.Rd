\title{Pooled Panel ARX(p,q) Forecasts from Stacked Matrices}
\usage{
forecast_panel_arx(Y, X, id, time, p, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{NT x 1 matrix (or vector) of the dependent variable stacked by unit over time.}

\item{X}{NT x P matrix of exogenous regressors stacked the same way.}

\item{id}{Vector of unit identifiers (length NT).}

\item{time}{Vector of time indices (length NT).}

\item{p}{Integer; number of lags of Y.}

\item{q}{Integer; number of lags of X.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of length N (number of units) containing the one-step-ahead forecasts.
}
\description{
Computes one-step-ahead forecasts using a pooled ARX(p,q) model on panel data
where inputs are NT x 1 and NT x P stacked matrices. Homogeneous coefficients are assumed.
