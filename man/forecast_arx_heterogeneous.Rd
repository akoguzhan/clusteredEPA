\title{Unit-Level ARX(p,q) Forecasts for Panel Data (Fully Heterogeneous)}
\usage{
forecast_arx_heterogeneous(Y, X, id, time, p, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A numeric vector of length NT (stacked panel data of the dependent variable).}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix of size NT x P (stacked panel data of regressors).}

\item{id}{A vector of unit identifiers of length NT.}

\item{time}{A vector of time identifiers of length NT.}

\item{p}{Number of lags for Y.}

\item{q}{Number of lags for X.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of length N containing one-step-ahead forecasts per unit.
}
\description{
Computes one-step-ahead forecasts for panel data by estimating separate ARX(p,q)
models for each unit using OLS. Each unit has its own model and coefficients.
